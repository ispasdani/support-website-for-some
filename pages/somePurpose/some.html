        <p class="text">
          For the purpose of this project we choose to use the social media
          platforms Tiktok, Instagram and Facebook. For each of these platforms
          we created a specific purpose:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Tiktok:</span> Through Tiktok we want to
            connect with the emotions of our users, so they feel connected with
            BAA and Aarhus on an emotional basis. The video’s we will post will
            not necessarily contain a lot of important information regarding
            studying at BAA, but will provide information about social life here
            in Aarhus. Give the users an insight of life as a student so they
            know what to expect from that. Tiktok is getting more and more
            popular and is now the 6th most-used social media platform in the
            world. The best time to post on tiktok depends on the day of
            posting: Monday: 04:00, 12:00, 16:00 Tuesday: 04:00, 08:00, 10:00,
            15:00 Wednesday: 13:00, 14:00 Thursday: 05:00, 15:00, 18:00 Friday:
            01:00, 11:00, 19:00, 21:00 Saturday: 17:00 Sunday: 01:00, 02:00,
            13:00, 14:00, 22:00
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Instagram:</span> Through Instagram we try
            to interact with our users. It is always fun to interact with the
            users and in this way we give them a voice while also finding out
            what they want. In this way we can at the same time improve our
            content for the future. In 2021 Instagram had 2 billion active
            monthly users, this gives a high potential of reaching our target
            group. It is best to post on instagram between 6 and 8 a.m., where
            people are on their way to work or school for example, and between 5
            and 8 p.m., where they are on their way back home for example.
            Looking at the best days to post content the beginning of the week
            and fridays perform best.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Facebook:</span> Facebook will be the
            platform we use to really inform the users, where Tiktok and
            Instagram are a bit more fun, Facebook will be the more serious
            platform. Here the users can find all the important information they
            need. Facebook users are around 18 26 years old, which fit our
            target group since students are around that age. While many
            professionals and commuters also check Facebook in the morning
            before work, the best time to post to Facebook is in the afternoon
            between 1 and 4 p.m. and in the evening between 6 and 10 p.m. All
            together there is also a huge overlap between these three apps which
            makes it easy to connect the campaign all together. The overlap
            between Tiktok users and Facebook users is 84.6% and between Tiktok
            users and Instagram users there is a 83.9% overlap. These
            percentages are huge and using this in the correct way would really
            benefit our reach of users.

        <p class="sub-title pushed">b. Strategic considerations</p>
        <p class="text">
          SOME strategy and plan must be based on a discussion of the questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What do we want to achieve with our presence on SOME - and how does

          <li>
            Which types of users do we have and what type of content are the
            most likely to react on/interact with?
            <ul>
              <li>
                young users who are affine with technology →young people like
                more short interesting videos or content in general (short
                attention span)
              </li>
