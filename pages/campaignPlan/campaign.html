            On the 18.02 We want to post a TikTok which is a recap about
            previous party's at BAA. That should tell the users how BAAA creates
            Parties or events for students, how much fun it is to hang out with
            your friends or meet new people. Here we include/create a # which
            could say #BAAApartymood so we want them to create TikTok with that
            Hashtag. So there is the chance that the videos go viral and a lot
            of people join the Hashtag. Also maybe old students who are not
            studying anymore can remember the fun time they had and want to
            share their experience.

            The 24. February is a Friday and what is on Fridays? YES! The Friday
            Basement Bar! Here we would like to create a post that informs a
            little about what the BAA offers to socialize with other students.
            The Fridays Basement Bar is perfect for this, because what better
            way to pass the week with a cold drink, good music and surrounded by
            cool people? We want to give users the feeling of community and
            challenge them to take the hashtag #FridayBar and show us who they
            go to the Basement Bar with, what they do whether chatting or
            playing beer pong and thus show future students how much fun you can
            have at BAAA.

            Our last UCG post is also another Instagram Post. It's on the 03rd
            March, also a Friday. It is also based on a hashtag, #repBAAA,
            prompting users, in this case again, students, to post any type of
            content on social media featuring the Academy. The hashtag turns any
            student into the Academy's representative, being an ambassador for
            the school.
